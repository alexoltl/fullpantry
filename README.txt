To set up the program, you need to install NodeJS LTS (https://nodejs.org/en). 
When the program has finished installing, restart to apply all changes. 
Once done, open up command prompt, navigate to this folder by copying the link in file explorer and running "cd (foldername)", and then run "npm install", to install all dependencies. 
Once all the dependencies have been installed, you should be able to start the localhost server by running "npm app.js".
